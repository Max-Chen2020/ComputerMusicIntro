# Intro to Computer Music with Pd

## Why computer music?

Things you can explore with computer music:

- timbre
    + synthesis
    + recordings
- control
    + (no humans)
    + automation
- not-control
    + randomness
- interaction. connect to:
    + robots
    + internet
    + visuals
    + audience
    + lights
    + sensors
    + data
    + instruments
    + new interfaces (for musical expression)

## Why Pure Data (Pd)

- free
- old
- works on everything
- visual

## Real Life Examples:

- Music for Vibraphone and Computer
- Facetracker
- Nordlig Vinter

## Code Examples:

- Synthesis:
    + hello world sine tone
    + Basic Additive Sine Tones
    + FM Synthesis
- Recordings:
    + Playing back a sound file
    + messing with a sound file
- Control
    + ADSR Envelope Generator
    + Controlling multiple instruments
- Not-Control
    + Random Values
    + Markov Chains
- Interaction
    + Fiddle and Bonk
    + Sensors
    + New Interface
    + MIDI / OSC

## Why not Pure Data?
- visual programming sucks
    + make 10 synths? copy and pastes
    + make 100 synths? Need a "for" loop to repeat commands.
